  "content": "On build day 1, we started measuring the wood and PVC for the parts of our prototype. We measured out the parts for the legs and top, as well as the PVC for the axle of our prototype. Our group received training on how to use the power tools. At the end, we started cutting one of the sections for the leg. On build day 2, despite the lack of our two most competent builders, we managed to make the rest of the cuts measured the day prior. We also improved the CAD models for our 3D-printed parts.",
