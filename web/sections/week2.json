    "The first build day of week 2 was dedicated to making up for the time we lost on the last build day. Though our teacher had tried to restart our print over the weekend, when we checked out the printer at the beginning of build time, it was sitting idle with the SD card removed and a half-finished print (that turned out to not even be ours) on the plate. We had to try once again to get the print to work. Meanwhile, we tried a couple more times to drill our base together, even attempting to use wood glue as a substitute for screws, before finally figuring out how to do it properly. We assembled both bases and added wood glue to help hold them in place.",
    "By the second day of week 2, Kai had asked Ruby Shampine from Cohort 6 (whose project on water or something you should definitely go check out) to 3D print the 3D parts with a much higher chance of success than trying to use the school's printers again. This meant that we did not have our 3D printed parts to assemble the pulley system, but we at least put together both blocks and managed to test their ability to block a flow of water. (Info on testing can be found in the Testing section.) Though our build time was now officially over, we petitioned our teacher to allow us to finish with our 3D printed parts at lunch the next day. At this point, we were on the home stretch."
