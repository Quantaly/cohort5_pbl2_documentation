    "The first build day of week 2 was dedicated to making up for the time we lost on the last build day. Though our teacher had tried to restart our print over the weekend, when we checked out the printer at the beginning of build time, it was sitting idle with the SD card removed and a half-finished print (that turned out to not even be ours) on the plate. We had to try once again to get the print to work. Meanwhile, we tried a couple more times to drill our base together, even attempting to use wood glue as a substitute for screws, before finally figuring out how to do it properly. We assembled both bases and added wood glue to help hold them in place."
