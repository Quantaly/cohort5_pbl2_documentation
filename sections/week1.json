    "On build day 1, we started measuring the wood and PVC for the parts of our prototype. We measured out the parts for the legs and top, as well as the PVC for the axle of our prototype. Our group received training on how to use the power tools. At the end, we started cutting one of the sections for the leg.",
    "On build day 2, despite missing two group members, we managed to make the rest of the cuts measured the day prior. We also improved the CAD models for our 3D-printed parts.",
    "Build day 3 was nothing short of a disaster. We tried to start 3D-printing our parts, but found at the end of the day that the 3D printer had had a seizure and failed to complete the print. Meanwhile, we discovered that it was very difficult to drill a screw through angled planks, and ended up stripping three before ultimately having to clean up."
