    "The first build day of week 2 was dedicated to making up for the time we lost on the last build day. Though our teacher had tried to restart our print over the weekend, when we checked out the printer at the beginning of build time, it was sitting idle with the SD card removed and a half-finished print (that turned out to not even be ours) on the plate. We had to try once again to get the print to work. Meanwhile, we tried a couple more times to drill our base together, even attempting to use wood glue as a substitute, before finally succeeding?? Yeah maybe I should wait for today to be over before documenting it."
